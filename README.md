## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I have a chance to redo some basic responsive components with the help of Sass and BEM such as:
- Navigation bar
- Item Card 
- Switch toggle
- Pricing card
- Table
- Footer

I did learn a lot of tips, tricks and techniques for: 
- Reset defaults
- SVG icon
- Responsive image using <picture>
- Using ::before and ::after for almost everything 
- Working with table
- Min(), max(), clamp()

### Continued development

There is a lot of things that I don't even know existed. 
For the next project, I would focus more on SVG because I struggled so much. It took me about 3 days just to get to SVG icon display as I wanted. Other than that, reading documents and do more research is a must :D

### Useful resources

- [Responsive table](https://codepen.io/AllThingsSmitty/pen/MyqmdM) - This sure helped me get through the table section.
- [Styling SVG](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/07/16/styling-svg-use-content-css/) - Colorize the SVG icon using variables
